En MediaWiki, es fÃ¡cil revisar los cambios recientes y revertir los daÃ±os realizados por usuarios malintencionados o novatos.
Sin embargo, muchos han encontrado que MediaWiki es Ãºtil para una amplia variedad de funciones, y a veces no es fÃ¡cil convencer a todos de los beneficios de la forma wiki.
Por lo tanto tienes la elecciÃ³n.

Un '''{{int:config-profile-wiki}}''' permite que cualquiera pueda editar, sin siquiera iniciar sesiÃ³n.
Un wiki con '''{{int:config-profile-no-anon}}''' ofrece rendiciÃ³n de cuentas adicional, pero puede disuadir a colaboradores.

El escenario '''{{int:config-profile-fishbowl}}''' permite editar a los usuarios autorizados, pero el pÃºblico puede ver las pÃ¡ginas, incluyendo el historial.
Un '''{{int:config-profile-private}}''' sÃ³lo permite ver pÃ¡ginas a los usuarios autorizados, el mismo grupo al que le estÃ¡ permitido editar.
